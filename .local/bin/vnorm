# (1)  `-c:v libx264`                  - Uses the x264 codec
# (2)  `-preset slow`                  - Uses a slow encoding preset
# (3)  `-crf 18`                       - Sets a constant rate factor to 'visually lossless'
# (4)  `-c:a aac`                      - Converts the audio stream to the "Advanced Audio Coding" codec
# (5)  `-ar 48000`                     - Sets the sampling frequency/sample rate to 48kHz
# (6)  `-ac 2`                         - Downmixes surround audio to stereo
# (7)  `-b:a 384k                      - Sets the bit rate to the minimum of 384k
# (8)  `-profile:v high`               - YouTube recommends us to use a H.264 profile of "High -level 4.0"
# (9)  `-level 4.0`                    - YouTube recommends us to use a H.264 profile of "High -level 4.0"
# (10) `-bf 2`                         - Sets 2 consecutive B frames. ffmpeg's default is 16
# (11) `-coder 1`                      - sets the entropy encoder to CABAC
# (12) `-pix_fmt yuv420p`              - Sets the aspect ratio to 16:9
# (13) `-b:v 10M`                      - Sets the bitrate to 10Mbps
# (14) `-threads 4`                    - Enables FFMpeg to use 4 threads for multi-core CPUs
# (15) `-cpu-used 0`                   - Most CPU intensive, but best fastest. Uses all cores.
# (16) `-r 60`                         - This is not required by YouTube but optional. The current
#                                        maximum supported frame rate on YouTube is 60fps. You can
#                                        upload at whatever FPS you want, but if you want to
#                                        downsample the content yourself you can use this. It might
#                                        save you some time waiting for YouTube to encode the video.
